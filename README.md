# Polyxia documentation

This folder contains the source code of the [Polyxia documentation website](#).

## Contributing

You can [submit an issue](https://github.com/orgs/polyxia-org/repositories) with documentation request or submit a pull request with suggested changes.

To help you, all the documentation pages have a button **Edit this page** at the right to go directly to the associated markdown file on the repository.

Please refer to the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](#) for contributing guidelines.

## Development

Below a guide to help you run the website locally and preview changes before submitting them.

Please ensure that your environment match the following requirements :

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v17+)

To run the website locally :

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The website should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000. Next.js will automatically reload your changes. When you're done, stop the server by hitting `CTRL+C`.
