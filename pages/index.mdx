**Polyxia** is a voice assistant project created by **DevOps students at Polytech Montpellier** that includes a FaaS architecture based on [Morty](https://morty-faas.github.io/).

In addition, Polyxia features an NLU algorithm for detecting user intent from text generated through a speech-to-text algorithm that translates the user's voice command into text. This intent is then sent to the FaaS to schedule a function associated with the intent.

## Project Features

- NLU algorithm for intent detection from user text input
- Speech-to-text algorithm for converting user voice commands into text
- Text-to-speech algorithm for converting the NLU's text result into voice
- Scheduled function execution based on user intent
